  abstract = 	 {In value-based reinforcement learning methods such as deep Q-learning, function approximation errors are known to lead to overestimated value estimates and suboptimal policies. We show that this problem persists in an actor-critic setting and propose novel mechanisms to minimize its effects on both the actor and the critic. Our algorithm builds on Double Q-learning, by taking the minimum value between a pair of critics to limit overestimation. We draw the connection between target networks and overestimation bias, and suggest delaying policy updates to reduce per-update error and further improve performance. We evaluate our method on the suite of OpenAI gym tasks, outperforming the state of the art in every environment tested.}

Still, many of these applications use conventional architectures, such as convolutional networks, LSTMs, or auto-encoders. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture for model-free reinforcement learning. Our dueling network represents two separate estimators: one for the state value function and one for the state-dependent action advantage function. The main benefit of this factoring is to generalize learning across actions without imposing any change to the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results show that this architecture leads to better policy evaluation in the presence of many similar-valued actions. Moreover, the dueling architecture enables our RL agent to outperform the state-of-the-art on the Atari 2600 domain.}

The proposed algorithm aims at maximally reducing the customer satisfaction-involved operational cost considering the potential uncertainties, while balancing the real-time supply and demand by adjusting the optimally scheduled charging/discharging of EV mobile/local battery storage, grid supply, and deferrable load. The chanceconstrained optimization objective has been stated in stages: 1) stage I, optimization of day-ahead energy management schedules; 2) stage II, multitiered EV charging price update and optimization of discharging participation bonus; 3) stage III, optimization of hour-ahead energy management schedules; and 4) stage IV, real-time control. Such algorithm provides more resilience for unpredictable conditions, provides more incentives for EV users to participate, and better coordinates the integrated system including the building load to reliably serve the customers while lessening cost. Case studies are implemented and the comparison analysis is performed in terms of the use and benefit of each design feature of the algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the operational cost and at the same time provide higher tolerability toward uncertainties.},

	abstract = {��在电动汽车( Electric Vehicle，EV )技术进步的推动下，电动汽车已成为智能电网经济的重要组成部分。当电动汽车参与具有实时定价信号的需求响应计划时，充分利用这些定价信号可以大大降低充电成本。然而，由于交通状况、用户通勤行为以及效用的定价过程中存在随机性，确定最优的充电策略具有挑战性。传统的基于模型的方法需要对调度过程的不确定性和优化进行预测。本文将该调度问题建模为转移概率未知的马尔科夫决策过程( Markov Decision Process，MDP )。提出了一种基于深度强化学习的无模型方法来确定该问题的最优策略。所提方法能够自适应地学习转移概率，且不需要任何系统模型信息。体系结构Driven by the recent advances in electric vehicle (EV) technologies, EVs have become important for smart grid economy. When EVs participate in demand response program which has real-time pricing signals, the charging cost can be greatly reduced by taking full advantage of these pricing signals. However, it is challenging to determine an optimal charging strategy due to the existence of randomness in traffic conditions, user’s commuting behavior, and the pricing process of the utility. Conventional model-based approaches require a model of forecast on the uncertainty and optimization for the scheduling process. In this paper, we formulate this scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with unknown transition probability. A model-free approach based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to determine the optimal strategy for this problem. The proposed approach can adaptively learn the transition probability and does not require any system model information. The architecture of the proposed approach contains two networks: a representation network to extract discriminative features from the electricity prices and a Q network to approximate the optimal action-value function. Numerous experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {��电动汽车（EV）渗透率的提高给电力网络带来了一些挑战，例如不确定的峰值负载和停电期间的弹性问题。通过在充电站中使用本地静态电池能量存储系统（BESS），可以实现弹性和调峰功能。然而，弹性和峰值是矛盾的，即增加一个会使另一个恶化。因此，在本研究中，提出了一种弹性和调峰权衡方案，以优化利用静态BESS。首先，制定了一个弹性窗口，以确定BESS中存储的能量量，以便在任何意外情况下电动汽车的弹性。在一天的高峰时段，更重要的是调峰，而在非高峰时段，恢复力被优先考虑。然后，开发了一种优化算法，以最小化系统成本，同时保持弹性并最大化调峰。使用所提出的窗口方法，通过归一化方法确定了最佳窗口大小。通过考虑弹性和调峰的冲突性质，已经进行了模拟，以显示所提出的方案的有效性。借助所提出的策略，实现了额外3.9\%的调峰和3.41\%的运营成本降低。此外，通过考虑可能影响弹性窗口最佳大小的不同因素（市场价格、电动汽车车队规模和BESS规模）进行了敏感性分析。Enhanced penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) poses several challenges to the power network, such as uncertain peak loads and resilience issues during outages. Both resilience and peak shaving functions can be achieved by using a local static battery energy storage system (BESS) in the charging stations. However, resilience and peakshaving are contradictory, i.e. increasing one will deteriorate the other. Therefore, in this study, a resilience and peak shaving trade-off scheme is proposed to optimally utilize the static BESS. Firstly, a resilience window is formulated to determine the amount of energy to be stored in the BESS for the resilienceof EVs in the case of any contingency. During peak hours of the day, more importance is given to peak-shaving, whereas in the off-peak hours, resilience is prioritized. Then, an optimization algorithm is developed to minimize the cost of the system while maintaining resilience and maximizing peak shaving. Using the proposed window method, an optimal window size has been determined via a normalization approach. Simulations have been carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by considering the conflicting nature of resilience and peak shaving. With the help of the proposed strategy additional 3.9 \% of peak shaving and 3.41 \% reduction operational costs is achieved. Moreover, sensitivity analysis has been carried out by considering different factors (market price, size of EV fleet, and BESS size) that can affect the optimal size of the resilience window.},

The charging time and charging demand are important challenges for EV adaptation. In order to address these challenges, a DC fast charging technology with a dynamic energy management system is proposed in this study. However, DC fast chargers require high power demand periods to reduce the charging time. This, in turn, will cause negative effects on the grid such as stability, resilience, and efficiency problems. The purpose of the study is to evaluate a hybrid DC fast charging station with the aim of reducing peak demand during charging periods. The proposed energy management algorithm together with the dynamic data use provides more reliable results on such systems operations.

However, a key hurdle in the growth of demand response is the lack of widespread availability of advanced metering infrastructure, which has stymied the adoption of dynamic pricing. We believe that this hurdle will be partially addressed by the growth of electric vehicles (EVs), as smart and connected EV parking lots will be a provider of demand response. We develop a two-layer optimization model that simultaneously determines dynamic pricing policy for the system operator and demand response strategies for the EV parking lots. The model minimizes the cost to consumers, while ensuring the system operator's revenue neutral status and addressing real-time price uncertainties. A variant of the 5-bus PJM network is used to demonstrate model implementation. Numerical results show that for a low to moderate price spike scenario, dynamic pricing with demand response from EVs alone can lower the daily average consumer cost of 1.42\% compared to the cost of flat pricing. A cost reduction of 6.5\% is achieved when price spikes are relatively high. Computational challenges of implementing our model for real networks are discussed in the concluding remarks.},

Specifically, workplace charging can alleviate the curtailment of renewable resources, while providing charging opportunities to long-range commuters. In this work, a comprehensive smart-charging protocol for workplace charging is proposed. The protocol first uses an ordering strategy, based on each vehicle’s load shifting flexibility, to develop a queue. Next, a decentralized smart-charging strategy is used that allows battery electric vehicles to generate their own charging profile via linear programming. By using an appropriate cost signal, the proposed smart-charging strategy can generate a parking structure demand load with desirable characteristics. Finally, an assignment algorithm is proposed to assign battery electric vehicles to octopus chargers. Driving patterns from the National Household Travel Survey are used to simulate workplace charging for parking structures under various charging scenarios. The proposed ordering strategy resulted in improved peak reductions for all simulated charging scenarios, when compared with chronological ordering. Furthermore, monthly electricity costs and the number of required chargers were both reduced in all cases where smart charging was combined with the proposed ordering strategy, compared to uncontrolled charging. Thus, the proposed protocol can reduce electricity and charging infrastructure costs associated with workplace charging.},

	abstract = {��在未来的智能电网中，生产商管理分布式可再生能源（RES）（如光伏发电）的不确定性非常重要。电动汽车（EV）作为一种分布式能源（DER），被认为是解决这一问题的一个有前途的方案。本文针对具有光伏现场发电和电动汽车充电服务的商业建筑的建筑能源管理系统（BEMS），提出了一种交易式实时电动汽车充电管理方案。代替直接EV充电控制，所提出的EV充电管理方案应用基于交易能量概念的方法来解决实时EV充电管理。利用所提出的方案，BEMS可以在光伏发电和电动汽车停车的不确定性下调度其与外部电网的净电力交换，并在实时运行中实现其利润最大化。同时，电动汽车车主无需向BEMS提供任何进一步的私人信息（如未来的驾驶计划），而只需提供他们的实时充电要求和对拟议方案中BEMS定价信号的响应偏好设置。因此，作为充电服务提供商的BEMS只需要EV车主提供最少的必要信息。电动汽车车主的充电要求、响应曲线的偏好设置及其响应所需的报销由实时充电管理部门负责，其对需求响应的贡献由BEMS负责报销。利用丹麦国家旅游调查的真实驾驶数据进行了案例研究，以验证拟议框架。In the future smart grids, it is important for the prosumers to manage the uncertainties from the distributed renewable energy sources (RES) such as PV generation. As a type of distributed energy resources (DERs), electrical vehicles (EVs) are regarded as a promising solution of the problem. In this paper, a transactive real-time EV charging management scheme is proposed for the building energy management system (BEMS) of commercial buildings with PV on-site generation and EV charging services. Instead of direct EV charging control, the proposed EV charging management scheme applies a transactive energy concept based approach to address the real-time EV charging management. With the proposed scheme, the BEMS can schedule its net electricity exchange with the external grid under the uncertainties of PV generation and EV parking and maximize its profit in the real-time operation. Meanwhile, the EV owners need not provide the BEMS with any further private information (such as future driving plans) but only their real-time charging requirements and preference setting of the response to the BEMS’s pricing signal in the proposed scheme. As such, the BEMS as a charging service provider only requires the minimal necessary information from the EV owners. The EV owners’ charging requirements, preference setting of the response curves and their required reimbursements for the response are respected by the real-time charging management and their contributions to the demand response are reimbursed by the BEMS. Case studies with real world driving data from the Danish National Travel Survey were carried out to verify the proposed framework.},

emission in the transportation sector, governments all over 
the world favor the adoption of electric vehicle (EV), and 
advance the construction of charging facilities. The allocation 
of battery energy storage (BES) can improve the economics 
and flexibility of EV charging station. The emergency 
demand response (EDR) program is widely popular among 
consumers because of its flexibility and high incentive 
payments. In this paper, an optimal decision-making model 
of BES-assisted EV charging station participating in EDR is 
proposed. The queueing model is established to describe the 
EV charging station load profile, where the arrival rate and 
the service rate of EVs at the charging station is estimated 
through Poisson process and battery charging behaviors 
respectively. The mobility patterns of vehicles are generated 
via National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS) data 
set. EV charging station load profiles are obtained from the 
queueing analysis, and they are integrated in the proposed 
decision-making model with consideration of EDR for BES assisted EV charging station. The feasibility of the model is 
validated in different case studies, and the result shows that 
the deployment of BES is beneficial to the optimal operation 
strategy of fast charging stations.},

Specifically, we study how the charging network operator (CNO) can influence where EV users charge in order to optimize the utilization of fast charging stations. These charging decisions of private EV owners affect aggregate congestion at stations (i.e., waiting time) as well as the aggregate EV charging load across the network. In this work, we capture the resulting equilibrium wait times and electricity load through a so-called traffic and charge assignment problem (TCAP) in a fast charging station network. Our formulation allows us to: 1) Study the expected station wait times as well as the probability distribution of aggregate charging load of EVs in a FCS network in a mobility-aware fashion (an aspect unique to our work), while accounting for heterogeneities in users’ travel patterns, energy demands, and geographically variant electricity prices. 2) Analytically characterize the special threshold-based structure that determines how EV owners choose where to charge their vehicle at equilibrium, in response to the FCS’s charging price structure, users’ energy demands, and users’ mobility patterns. 3) Provide a convex optimization problem formulation to identify the network’s unique equilibrium. Furthermore, we illustrate how to induce a socially optimal charging behavior by deriving the socially optimal plug-in fees and electricity prices at the charging stations.},

The economic feasibility is assessed with the combined operation model of EVs for optimal bidding in the day-ahead energy market and FR market. The proposed optimization adopts the hierarchical control framework with EV aggregator (EVA) as the intermediate control unit to interact with the power system operator. As EVs are paid for FR based on their actual performance, a dynamic control strategy for charging EVs in response to regulation signals is developed to validate the technical feasibility of combined operation. The autonomous control of EVA modulates the charging of each EV to ensure the optimal charging schedules and real-time frequency control. A case study reveals that the profitability of EV charging control can be significantly increased by energy cost reduction and additional regulation revenue.

	abstract = {��电动汽车（EV）在过去几年中被广泛采用和部署，因为它们是环保的。当集成到智能电网中时，电动汽车可以作为灵活的负载或储能设备运行，以参与需求响应（DR）。通过利用DR中的时变电价，可以通过优化充电/放电时间表来降低充电成本。然而，由于EV的到达和离开时间以及电价存在随机性，因此难以确定最佳充电/放电时间表以确保EV在离开时完全充电。为了解决这个问题，我们将电动汽车充电/放电调度问题表述为约束马尔可夫决策过程（CMDP）。目的是找到一种受限的充电/放电调度策略，以最小化充电成本，并确保电动汽车能够充满电。为了解决CMDP，提出了一种基于安全深度强化学习（SDRL）的无模型方法。所提出的方法不需要关于随机性的任何领域知识。它直接学习用深度神经网络（DNN）生成约束的最优充电/放电计划。与现有的强化学习（RL）或深度RL（DRL）范式不同，所提出的方法不需要手动设计惩罚项或调整惩罚系数。实际电价的数值实验证明了所提出方法的有效性。Electric vehicles (EVs) have been popularly adopted and deployed over the past few years because they are environment-friendly. When integrated into smart grids, EVs can operate as flexible loads or energy storage devices to participate in demand response (DR). By taking advantage of time-varying electricity prices in DR, the charging cost can be reduced by optimizing the charging/discharging schedules. However, since there exists randomness in the arrival and departure time of an EV and the electricity price, it is difficult to determine the optimal charging/discharging schedules to guarantee that the EV is fully charged upon departure. To address this issue, we formulate the EV charging/discharging scheduling problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). The aim is to find a constrained charging/discharging scheduling strategy to minimize the charging cost as well as guarantee the EV can be fully charged. To solve the CMDP, a model-free approach based on safe deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) is proposed. The proposed approach does not require any domain knowledge about the randomness. It directly learns to generate the constrained optimal charging/discharging schedules with a deep neural network (DNN). Unlike existing reinforcement learning (RL) or deep RL (DRL) paradigms, the proposed approach does not need to manually design a penalty term or tune a penalty coefficient. Numerical experiments with real-world electricity prices demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

This study addresses the location-routing problem (LRP) for a general EV charging system with stochastic charging requests regarding their locations, arrival times and charging times. The objective is to develop an efficient routing strategy of EVs to charging stations, as well as to determine the optimal charging station locations so as to minimize the demand’s mean response time. Under some regularity assumptions on the mean waiting time at each charging station (e.g. system operates in a light or heavy traffic regime), we show that the optimization problem can be formulated as a partition-based clustering problem with size constraints. This relaxation of the problem formulation enables us to develop a novel data-driven approach for solving the charging station LRP, without requiring detailed stochastic models for the EV’s charging requests, as well as the queueing behavior of the charging stations. An algorithm along with two size adjustment strategies are developed to solve the obtained clustering problem and illustrated on urban areas of Seattle with various types of distance, vehicle speeds, distributions for charging request locations, and inter-arrival time densities.},

Initial DR studies mainly adopt model predictive control, but models are largely uncertain for the EV scenario (e.g., customer behavior). Model-free approaches, based on reinforcement learning (RL), are an attractive alternative. We propose a new Markov decision process (MDP) formulation in the RL framework, to jointly coordinate a set of charging stations. State-of-the-art algorithms either focus on a single EV, or control an aggregate of EVs in multiple steps (e.g., 1) make aggregate load decisions and 2) translate the aggregate decision to individual EVs). In contrast, our RL approach jointly controls the whole set of EVs at once. We contribute a new MDP formulation with a scalable state representation independent of the number of charging stations. Using a batch RL algorithm, fitted Q-iteration, we learn an optimal charging policy. With simulations using real-world data, we: 1) differentiate settings in training the RL policy (e.g., the time span covered by training data); 2) compare its performance to an oracle all-knowing benchmark (providing an upper performance bound); 3) analyze performance fluctuations throughout a full year; and 4) demonstrate generalization capacity to larger sets of charging stations.},

	abstract = {��快速充电是电动汽车（EV）的一种很有前途的能量补充方法，可将补充时间大大缩短至与行驶和排队时间相当的水平，因此将极大地影响EV用户的充电地点的决定。多个充电服务提供商（CSP）参与电动汽车快速充电设施的投资，不可避免地带来了彼此之间的竞争，这影响了投资者的规划决策。本文研究了竞争环境下电动汽车快速充电基础设施的规划策略，考虑了排队对电动汽车用户的影响。提出了一种双环迭代方法，外环寻求CSP规划方案的平衡点。在内环中建立了与排队理论和自适应路线选择算法相结合的用户均衡交通分配模型，以优化CSP的规划方案，以及车站级线性规划模型，以获得考虑使用时间价格和投资约束的现场储能系统（ESS）的最优规模和运行调度。案例研究验证了所提出方法的有效性，并表明忽略竞争对手的响应将导致对CSP吸引的充电需求及其总收益的高估。Fast charging is a promising method of energy refueling for electric vehicles (EVs), significantly shortening the refueling time to a level comparable with traveling and queuing times, which consequently will highly influence the decision of charging places for EV users. Multiple charging service providers (CSPs) are participating in the investment of EV fast charging facilities, inevitably bringing competition among each other, which affects the planning decision of investors. This article studies the planning strategy of EV fast charging infrastructure in a competitive environment, taking the queuing impacts on EV users into consideration. A double-loop iterative methodology is proposed, and the outer loop seeks the equilibrium point of the CSP’s planning schemes. A user equilibrium traffic assignment model integrated with queuing theory and an adaptive route selection algorithm are built in the inner loop to optimize the planning scheme of a CSP, along with a station-level linear programming model to obtain the optimal sizes and operation scheduling of on-site energy storage systems (ESSs) considering time-of-use prices and investment constraints. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal that ignoring the competitors’ response will cause overestimation of the CSP’s attracted charging demands and its total benefits.},

For the electrical grid, the flexibility of EV charging makes it a significant actor in “Demand Response” mechanisms. Therefore, there is a need to design incentive mechanisms to foster customer engagement. A congestion game approach is adopted to evaluate the performance of such electrical transportation system with multiple classes of vehicles: EV and Gasoline Vehicles. Both temporal and energy operating costs are considered. The latter is nonseparable as it depends on the global charging need of all EV, which is scheduled in time by a centralized aggregator in function of nonflexible consumption at charging location. Thus, driving and charging decisions are coupled. An adaptation of Beckmann’s method proves the existence of a Wardrop Equilibrium (WE) in the considered nonseparable congestion game; this WE is unique when the charging unit price is an increasing function of the global charging need. A condition on the nonflexible load is given to guarantee the monotonicity of this function. This condition is tested on real consumption data in France and in Texas, USA. Optimal tolls are used to control this electrical transportation system and then computed in order to minimize an environmental cost on a simple network topology.},

The objective is to minimize the total charging cost with user dissatisfaction taken into account. We focus on the online setting where neither accurate prediction nor distribution of future real-time prices is available to the user when making irrevocable charging decisions in each time slot. The emphasis on considering user dissatisfaction and achieving optimal competitive ratio differentiates our work from existing ones and makes our study uniquely challenging. Our key contribution is two simple online algorithms with the optimal competitive ratio among all deterministic algorithms. The optimal competitive ratio is upper-bounded by min\{α/pmin−−−−−−√,pmax/pmin\} and the bound is asymptotically tight with respect to α , where pmax and pmin are the upper and lower bounds of real-time prices and α≥pmin captures the consideration of user dissatisfaction. The bounds with respect to small and large values of α suggest the fundamental difference of the problems with and without considering user dissatisfaction. We also extend the algorithms to take minimum charging requirement and short-term prediction into account. Simulation results based on real-world traces corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the empirical performance of our algorithms can be substantially better than the theoretical worst-case guarantees. Our algorithms also achieve notable performance gains under diverse settings as compared to conceivable alternatives.},

Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their mobility and flexibility characteristics, can provide various ancillary services including active and reactive power. However, the distributed control of EVs under such scenarios is a complex decision-making problem with enormous dynamics and uncertainties. Most existing literature employs model-based approaches to formulate active and reactive power control problems, which require full models and are time-consuming. This article proposes a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm featuring a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method and a parameter sharing framework to solve the EVs’ coordinated active and reactive power control problem toward both demand-side response and voltage regulations. The proposed algorithm can further enhance the learning stability and scalability with privacy perseverance via the location marginal prices. Simulation results based on a modified IEEE 15-bus network are developed to validate its effectiveness in providing system charging and voltage regulation services. The proposed location marginal price (LMP) PSDDPG algorithm is evaluated to achieve 38\%, 16\%, and 25\% speedup, and 1.58, 0.69, and 0.27 times higher reward over the benchmarks DDPG, TD3, and LMP-DDPG, respectively.},

	abstract = {��PHEV（插电式混合动力电动汽车）的使用由于其低能源成本和低环境污染而迅速扩大。然而，最大的障碍是，即使在使用增压站时，PHEV的行驶里程短，电池充电时间长。因此，需要更好的排队模型来提高使用公共充电站的服务质量。在本文中，首先基于M/M/1排队模型模拟PHEV排队，其中M表示到达时间和服务时间的马尔可夫过程。然后，针对城市驾驶标准（FTP-72）模拟PHEV的电消耗，以更好地理解电池充电状态（SOC）的行为。此外，利用不同的循环分析了城市PHEV电池的放电特性。此外，还实现了一个计算机模型来研究PHEV在公共充电站的等待时间。仿真结果表明，通过考虑每个充电节点（站）的队列长度以及距离来分配充电站，可以显著减少每个站的队列长度。The use of PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) is fast expanding due to their low energy cost and low environmental pollution. However, the biggest hurdle is that PHEVs have short driving range and long battery charging time even when using supercharging stations. Therefore, better queuing models are necessary to improve the quality of services using public charging stations. In this paper, first the PHEV queue is simulated based on the M/M/1 queuing model, where M denotes a Markov process for both inter-arrival time and service times. Then, the electrical consumption of PHEVs is simulated for urban driving standard (FTP-72) to better understand of the behavior the battery state of charge (SOC). In addition, discharging characteristics of the PHEVs' batteries in urban city are analyzed using different cycles. Moreover, a computer model is implemented to study waiting time of PHEV at public charging stations. Simulation results suggest that, assigning charging stations by considering the queue length at each charging nodes (station), as well as the distance, considerably reduces the queue length at each station.},

This paper proposes an evolutionary curriculum learning (ECL)-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach for optimizing transformer LOL while considering various charging demands of different EV owners. Specifically, the problem of charging multiple EVs is cast as a Markov game. It is solved by the proposed MADRL algorithm by modeling each EV controller as an agent with a specific objective. During the centralized training stage, a novel centralized ECL mechanism is adopted to enhance the coordination of multiple EVs. It enables the proposed approach to address the management of large-scale EV charging. When the training procedure is completed, the proposed approach is deployed in a decentralized manner. Herein, all the agents make decisions based solely on local information. The decentralized manner of execution helps preserve the privacy of EV owners, reduce the related communication cost, and avoid single-point failure. Comparative tests utilizing real-world data demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve coordinated charging of a large number of EVs while satisfying the various charging demands of different EV owners.},

Hence, the penetration of EVs in some countries experiences steady growth. However, the proliferation of EVs can cause negative impacts on the power distribution network (PDN) and the transportation network (TN). Thus, in this paper, a dynamic pricing strategy for electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) is proposed to facilitate EVCSs to earn higher profits while alleviating the potential negative impacts on both PDN and TN. First, a pricing strategy, considering the competition effect established based on the TN, is formulated to facilitate the EVCS to attract the defined competitive charging demand. Second, a two-step approach is proposed to mathematically formulate the responsiveness of demand towards the charging price. Third, EV user behaviors are incorporated based on both an admission control scheme and a queueing model to further adjust the charging demand. We have conducted simulations to verify the effectiveness of the pricing strategy in a PDN and TN coupled system, which contains approximately 2000 EVs. Results show that the proposed pricing strategy can facilitate the EVCS to gain 14.2\% more net charging profit on average compared with the other three cases. Moreover, the operational stability of the EVCS can be ensured because the proposed pricing strategy can result in the least queueing length volatility with moderate profit variance compared with the other three cases. Furthermore, the proposed pricing strategy can achieve spatial load shifting by incentivizing EVs to alter their station-selection decisions to avoid possible power congestion in the electricity network.},

In this article, the bidirectional power flow between EV and grid; Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), is exploited. We make a profit from the unused electric power of EVs and we present an EV load management technique based on EV charging and EV discharging coordination. We propose a peak load management model (PLM) used to schedule EVs for charging or discharging service according to the power demand with the timing and location where each EV need to be served. Also, we propose an Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) selection model to guide EVs to the supply station. We develop a mathematical formalism for handling requests for EV charging/discharging at EVSE based on queuing theory. Those models are evaluated while considering the mobility of vehicles in an urban scenario and time-of-use-pricing (TOUP).

To evaluate this impact, the engineering practice is to run power flow studies at peak load, leading to a conservative result, or implement computationally expensive quasi-static time-series simulations. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a computational approach based on low-rank tensor approximation (LRA) for fast grid impact studies on distribution grid operation caused by commercial EV charging stations with demand uncertainties. To this end, a stochastic transportation model is implemented to predict the potential charging profiles of EV stations based on vehicles’ driving patterns, and the predicted charging demand is used to construct polynomial bases for the LRA algorithm. A methodology based on clustering approaches is proposed to strategically select the experimental samples for optimized determination of the coefficients, and the rank and degree of the LRA model are adaptively configured for improved performance. Test cases on a real-world utility feeder have demonstrated that the proposed approach is able to potentially reduce the time-series simulation time of distribution feeder circuits by around 99.99\% while maintaining a high accuracy.},

	abstract = {��随着电动汽车（EV）的日益普及和各种用户偏好，充电站通常提供几种不同的充电模式以满足EV的各种需求。如何有效利用充电容量，最大限度地降低服务掉线率，是充电站面临的一个紧迫而开放的问题。鉴于电动汽车车主对充电模式的价格敏感，我们打算设计一个最优定价方案，以最小化充电站的服务下降率。首先，我们将双模充电站的操作表述为具有多个服务器和异构服务速率的排队网络，并分析充电站的服务丢弃率与电动汽车选择之间的关系。然后，我们制定了一个客户损耗最小化问题，以最小化离开充电站而未充电的电动汽车的数量，并提出了一种最优定价方法，以指导和协调充电站中电动汽车的充电过程。进行了仿真，以评估所提出的充电调度方案的性能，并显示所提出的定价方案的效率。With the increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and various user preferences, charging stations often provide several different charging modes to satisfy the various requirements of EVs. How to effectively utilize the charging capacity to minimize the service dropping rate is a pressing and open issue for charging stations. Given that EV owners are price-sensitive to the charging modes, we intend to design an optimal pricing scheme to minimize the service dropping rate of the charging station. First, we formulate the operation of a dual-mode charging station as a queuing network with multiple servers and heterogeneous service rates, and analyze the relationship between the service dropping rate of the charging station and the selections of EVs. Then, we formulate a customer attrition minimization problem to minimize the number of EVs that leave the charging station without being charged and propose an optimal pricing approach to guide and coordinate the charging processes of EVs in the charging station. The simulation has been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed charging scheduling scheme and show the efficiency of the proposed pricing scheme.},

	abstract = {��随着受电比例的增加和当地机组调峰能力的不足，受电端电网难以实现谷时调峰。为了解决这一问题，同时考虑到电动汽车（EV）的大规模充电负载的潜力，本研究提出了一种基于聚合器的需求响应（DR）机制，用于在山谷时间参与峰值调节的电动汽车。在这种基于聚合器的DR机制中，考虑了电网运营的利润和电动汽车所有者的参与意愿。基于电动汽车充电过程和日前机组发电调度的特点，建立了具有DR的滚动机组承诺模型，以实现社会福利的最大化。此外，为了提高优化问题解决过程的效率并实现独立系统运营商（ISO）和聚合器之间的通信，使用聚类算法来提取典型的EV充电模式。最后，通过案例研究验证了基于聚合器的DR机制在节约成本和减少接收端电网峰谷差方面的可行性和益处。With the increase in the power receiving proportion and an insufficient peak regulation capacity of the local units, the receiving-end power grid struggles to achieve peak regulation in valley time. To solve this problem while considering the potential of the large-scale charge load of electric vehicles (EVs), an aggregator-based demand response (DR) mechanism for EVs that are participating in the peak regulation in valley time is proposed in this study. In this aggregator-based DR mechanism, the profits for the power grid’s operation and the participation willingness of the EV owners are considered. Based on the characteristics of the EV charging process and the day-ahead unit generation scheduling, a rolling unit commitment model with the DR is established to maximize the social welfare. In addition, to improve the efficiency of the optimization problem solving process and to achieve communication between the independent system operator (ISO) and the aggregators, the clustering algorithm is utilized to extract typical EV charging patterns. Finally, the feasibility and benefits of the aggregator-based DR mechanism for saving the costs and reducing the peak-valley difference of the receiving-end power grid are verified through case studies.},

  abstract={Photovoltaic-assisted charging station (PVCS) is expected to be one of the important charging facilities for serving electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, a type of solid-state transformer (SST) is introduced to the PVCS design and an autonomous energy management strategy (EMS) for SST is proposed. This study aims to develop an effective real-time EMS for PVCS participating in ancillary service of smart grid, and the rule-based decision-making method is utilized. Considering the dynamic classification of EVs, an energy-bound calculation (EBC) model is proposed to find the upper and lower bounds of flexible resources. Moreover, considering the EBC results and power command from the aggregator, a charging power allocation algorithm is designed for power distribution of flexible EVs. By case study and experiment analysis, the proposed EMS is effective in real-time energy management and suitable for practical applications.},

	abstract = {Within the context of sustainable development and a low-carbon economy, electric vehicles (EVs) are regarded as a promising alternative to engine vehicles. Since the increase of charging EVs brings new challenges to charging stations and distribution utility in terms of economy and reliability, EV charging should be coordinated to form a friendly and proper load. This paper proposes a novel approach for pricing of charging service fees in a public charging station based on prospect theory. This behavioral economics-based pricing mechanism will guide EV users to coordinated charging spontaneously. By introducing prospect theory, a model that reflects the EV owner’s response to price is established first, considering the price factor and the state-of-charge (SOC) of batteries. Meanwhile, the quantitative relationship between the utility value and the charging price or SOC is analyzed in detail. The EV owner’s response mechanism is used in modeling the charging load after pricing optimization. Accordingly, by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm, pricing optimization is performed to achieve multiple objectives such as minimizing the peak-to-valley ratio and electricity costs of the charging station. Through case studies, the determined time-of-use charging prices by pricing optimization is validated to be effective in coordinating EV users’ behavior, and benefiting both the station operator and power systems.},
